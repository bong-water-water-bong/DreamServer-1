# Changelog

All notable changes to Dream Server will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Linux cloud installs no longer launch or health-gate on local `llama-server`;
  the compose resolver now selects a cloud overlay, skips local-mode dependency
  overlays, and keeps Hermes SOUL persona generation outside the local-model
  path.
- Fleet distro lab Docker and Incus runners now take a shared host lock so
  tower2 distro dry-runs do not contend with heavy full-fleet install/build
  work on the same host.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Multi-distro release validation covering Ubuntu 24.04/22.04, Debian 12,
  Linux Mint 21.3, Fedora 41, Rocky Linux 9, Arch, Manjaro, CachyOS, and
  openSUSE Tumbleweed in CI/container form.
- tower2 Incus VM distro lab for real systemd, network, Docker daemon, Docker
  Compose, and installer dry-run coverage on Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 42, Rocky 9,
  Arch current, and openSUSE Tumbleweed.
- Sanitized validation matrix documenting the layered CI, distro lab, and
  real-hardware fleet surface, tested phases, release-readiness receipt, and
  current evidence boundaries.
- AMD runtime diagnostics endpoint (`/api/gpu/amd-runtime`) reports Lemonade vs
  llama-server, host vs container, accelerator backend, and health from
  explicit installer state.
- Explicit AMD inference env contract (`AMD_INFERENCE_RUNTIME`,
  `AMD_INFERENCE_BACKEND`, `AMD_INFERENCE_LOCATION`, `AMD_INFERENCE_PORT`) for
  Linux, Windows, and WSL/Docker Desktop installs.
- AMD runtime capability metadata (`AMD_INFERENCE_SUPPORTED_BACKENDS`,
  `AMD_INFERENCE_RUNTIME_MODE`, `AMD_INFERENCE_MANAGED`) for dashboard
  diagnostics and `dream doctor`.
- Release evidence and golden-path contracts for generated config, update
  rollback behavior, and downstream builder validation.

### Changed
- Linked public support, testing, and platform-claim docs to the validation
  matrix so release claims point at layered evidence instead of informal
  maintainer memory.
- Updated Dream Proxy and Hermes Proxy to `caddy:2.11.3-alpine`.
- Centralized AMD Lemonade runtime metadata in `config/backends/amd.json` and
  aligned the Linux Docker image pin to
  `ghcr.io/lemonade-sdk/lemonade-server:v10.2.0`.
- Hardened installer/runtime defaults for Hermes, OpenCode, Perplexica,
  bootstrap model swaps, update flows, and extension gating.

### Fixed
- Rocky/RHEL-family Docker installation now falls back to Docker's CentOS/RHEL
  repository when distro packages are unavailable.
- DNF package resolution now avoids `curl` vs `curl-minimal` conflicts on
  Fedora/RHEL-style systems.
- Windows AMD installs now pass deterministic runtime state into dashboard-api
  instead of requiring the container to infer host-side Lemonade vs Vulkan
  fallback.
- Perplexica, LiteLLM, OpenCode, bootstrap-upgrade, uninstall, macOS logging,
  and model-selection regressions fixed across the 2.5.0 cycle.

### Security
- Documented the retired LiveKit credential exposure as resolved so public audit
  readers do not mistake retired leaked values for active secrets.
- Added or expanded release contracts for dependency pinning, network exposure,
  support bundles, and secret scanning.

### Validation
- Full fleet pass on 2026-05-21 in
  `/home/michael/dream-fleet-test/runs/2026-05-21T15-48-27Z`.
- Hardware fleet: tower2, Strix Halo, Spark, Mac mini, and M5 MacBook Pro all
  passed install, 7/7 verify, Hermes seeded echo, UI checks, and applicable
  capability probes.
- Regressions: 9/9 fixtures green, 0 bugs detected, 0 PRs opened.
- Distro lab: Docker matrix passed 10/10 distros; Incus VM matrix passed 5/5
  VMs with real systemd + Docker and clean installer dry-runs.
- Known follow-up: concurrent `fleet-multi-distro.sh` and a heavy
  `dream-fleet-test` install on the same host can create I/O contention. Prefer
  serialization or a future `--parallel-limit` flag when running both surfaces
  together.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Native AMD Lemonade inference backend with NPU + ROCm + Vulkan acceleration
- LiteLLM model aliasing for AMD (friendly model names resolve to Lemonade internal IDs)
- AMD/Lemonade contract test suite (17 tests in `tests/contracts/test-amd-lemonade-contracts.sh`)
- Lemonade Docker image pinned to v10.0.0 with libatomic1 fix (`Dockerfile.amd`)
- Host-systemd service support in dashboard health checks (OpenCode no longer grayed out)
- `DREAM_MODE=lemonade` for AMD installs — routes all services through LiteLLM proxy
- Bootstrap model aliasing — both tier and bootstrap model names resolve in LiteLLM
- NPU detection on Windows (Win32_PnPEntity) and Linux (sysfs/lspci)

### Changed
- AMD backend upgraded from generic Vulkan llama-server to native Lemonade Server
- LiteLLM runs as default inference proxy on AMD installs
- Lemonade image pinned to v10.0.0 (no longer `:latest`)

### Fixed
- APE healthcheck replaced curl (missing in slim image) with python3 urllib
- Windows installer surfaces docker compose config errors on failure instead of just exit code
- Windows installer passes `--env-file .env` to docker compose for reliable variable loading
- Dashboard no longer grays out host-systemd services unreachable from Docker
- `.env.schema.json` updated for `DREAM_MODE=lemonade`, `TARGET_API_KEY`, `LLM_BACKEND`, `LLM_API_BASE_PATH`
- Lemonade entrypoint uses absolute path (`/opt/lemonade/lemonade-server`)
- Service health endpoint override for Lemonade (`/api/v1/health` vs `/health`)
- Perplexica, Privacy Shield, OpenClaw, Open WebUI API paths corrected for Lemonade (`/api/v1`)
- OpenCode config filename (`config.json` copy), LiteLLM routing, and small_model fallback
